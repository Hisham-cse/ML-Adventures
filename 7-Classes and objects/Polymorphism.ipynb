It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces"

    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a powerful feature of OOP that allows for flexibility and integration in code design. It enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implementation of a method. By understanding and applying polymorphism, you can create more extensible and maintainable object-oriented programs."
