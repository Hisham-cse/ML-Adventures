# what is tuple in python

# Tuple is a collection of data which is ordered and unchangeable. It is written with round brackets. It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.). It is similar to a list, but it is immutable, which means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified.
