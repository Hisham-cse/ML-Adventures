What is data structure?

Data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. It involves the use of algorithms and data types to store and manipulate data in a structured way.

What is algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a computation. It is a sequence of instructions that are followed to achieve a desired outcome. Algorithms are used in computer science to solve problems, perform computations, and manipulate data.

What is the difference between data structure and algorithm?
Data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in a computer, while algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a computation. Data structures are used to store and manipulate data efficiently, while algorithms are used to solve problems and perform computations.
